# Scalax_Client

This is the admin part of the scalax experimental project (for fun :) ), its a console app meant to gain simple virtual shell-like access overseas into any other (win, mac, linux) that has the other (client-part) installed on it. it also has some built-in ready commands to get/send files (any type of files).

!- (The whole project was devoloped in a couple of hours and so isn't meant to be strongly written at all, therfore uses alot of bad stupid practices! :]



- This project uses .NET6 cross-platform console app template, signalR packages.
