# Scalax_Client

This is the client/target part of the scalax experimental project (for fun :) ), its a console app meant to give simple virtual shell access overseas into any other (admin-part) installed on the controller device.

!- (The whole project was devoloped in a couple of hours and so isn't meant to be strongly written at all, therfore uses alot of bad stupid practices! :]


- This project uses .NET6 cross-platform console app template, signalR packages.
